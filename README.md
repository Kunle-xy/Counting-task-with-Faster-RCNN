# counting-task-with-Faster-RCNN
This notebook uses data from https://zindi.africa/competitions/wadhwani-ai-bollworm-counting-challenge to train a Faster-RCNN model. In doing so, the data were first preprocessed and further refined.
Going forward, i will be adding more comments and additonal lines of code as i improve the model accuracy.
